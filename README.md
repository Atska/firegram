## About

This project is showcasing pathfinding and maze algorithms. At the beginning I was interested in the basics of software engineering and wanted to learn more about algorithms and data structures. At the end I did this fun, challenging, furiously frustrating yet so extremely rewarding project.

#### What I learned
- Algorithmic thinking: Slicing a problem in many different subproblems and solve each of them step by step.
- Data structures: Queues, stacks, heaps, sets and so on. When to use them and write one on your own if you need it.
- Graph traversal: Must-know stuff like depth-first-search or breadth-first-search, writing recursive function and its pros and cons.
- That css is hard.
