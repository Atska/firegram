## About

This project is a fullstack application with a backend written with Node.js + Express.js. Firebase, GoogleÂ´s backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform for mobile and web apps, was used to implement the authentication and Cloud Firestore serves as the No-SQL database. The frontend technologies include ReactJS and the design system Material UI.

#### What I learned
- Writing RESTful Web services and working with the standard HTTP Methods.
- Working with JSON data format.
- Designing a database system and working with a nosql-database.
- Building an authentication system with JSON Web Tokens.
- Creating a frontend app which communicates with the backend, private routing and 
  basic crud functionality
